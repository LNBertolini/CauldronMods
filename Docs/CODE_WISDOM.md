# Assumulated Coding Wisdom

## UsePowerNumerals
UsePower implementation must use `GetPowerNumeral()` in place of hard coded integers.
This is to support Guise + Harpy edge cases.
This is only for actual numbers (1,2,3) and not words (one, two, three).

## Revealed Cards
When cards are revealed the engine moves those cards to a special location.
Cards must be explicitly moved back to a real location before the end of the effect.
